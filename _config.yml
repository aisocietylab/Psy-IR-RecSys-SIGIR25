title: "Psychological Aspects in Retrieval and Recommendation Tutorial"
email: innerebner@tugraz.at
description: >- # this means to ignore newline"
  Psychological processes play a critical role in shaping users' interactions with information retrieval (IR) and recommender systems
  (RS). Therefore, understanding human cognition, decision-making,
  and emotions is vital to enable user-centric retrieval and recommendation systems. Vice versa, understanding whether these aspects
  are also present in the systems themselves (e.g., in training data,
  ranking models, or outputs), or even injecting them on purpose,
  can inform the development of psychology-inspired systems. The
  purpose of this tutorial is to provide its attendees with an introduction to psychological concepts that are important in the ecosystem
  of search, retrieval, and recommendation, in particular, cognitive
  architectures, cognitive effects and biases, as well as personality and
  affect. Leveraging corresponding models allows its audience to build
  or refine psychology-informed IR and RS technology. The interdisciplinary tutorial requires intermediate expertise in terms of IR and
  RS, while we do not assume knowledge in psychology.
